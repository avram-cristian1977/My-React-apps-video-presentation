React Mr Meme

This is an app that can help you to manage a company employees, hire, fire, state update, ratings, custom search
and a variety of statistics presented through charts design
Authentication (sign up firebase api and sign in firebase api) and localStorage item. (app survives refresh)

I used Redux without toolkit (firebase auth token state, localSorage state, login/logout dispatch), 
Firebase Realtime Database (for CRUD operation),
Firebase Authentication (for app users management), Charts JS, Semantinc UI, routing.
