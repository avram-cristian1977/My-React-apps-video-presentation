								Ibanez Guitars Shop

	This is a simple client/server guitars manager project.

	In the visitor mode, application display all the guitars (graphql queries) with pagination feature , guitar categories (graphql entities relationship) together with a Hot Deal compoment that expose the store current discounts (for example, free shipping). Also, the application implements a searching product feauture, details product parametrized route and it consumes an converting currency API.

	In the admin mode (./admin, email:admin@admin.com, password: 123456), graphql mutations can be performed, such as updating a product price, toggling availability or hot-deal status. As well, removing or creating new product can easly be done. 


	I used React(apollo-client), graphql(apollo-server), redux toolkit (async thunk), firebase (authentication APIs), NodeJS, React-elastic-carousel, React-loading-spinner, lodash, Corel Suite, etc.
