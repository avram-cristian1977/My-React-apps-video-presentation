React-monsters-vs-angels-simulator

This application is created based upon a simple fight algorithm, consisting in interation of a two objects (monster and angel) which are saved in separate firebase collection and therefore every user has his own profile and his own monsters and angels. The algorithm has factors like attack, defense and special powers which are user inputs but also factors like luck which is a factor in a battle indeed.:) When battle ends, UI offer the user stats based on rounds. The looser is also automatically deleted from the user characters list but also from the db. Users can contact the support team by sending an email, which is possible thank to the emailJS implementation. UI has an parallax aproach, is responsive, redux management for auth and localStorage structured in routes.
