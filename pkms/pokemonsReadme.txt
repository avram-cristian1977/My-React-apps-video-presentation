Pokemons

This is a little project that brings to the client a list of specific pokemons generation (1st generation) from the API.
I used React, redux toolkit (async thunk), styled components, git flow new branch / commits and a very funny function that implements a voice menu.

The source code here (development branch) :

Thank you for your attention!
